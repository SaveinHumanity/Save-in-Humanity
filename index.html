<h1> WHAT WE DO </h1>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>Our work with grassroots partners in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe in education and childrenâ€™s rights is making a real difference to the lives of over 5,000 children born into poverty every year. 
    <br> <br> 

Helping children off the streets and into school gives them a chance to improve their lives and build a better future.
<br> <br>

<h2>WHAT OUR PROJECTS MEAN</h2>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>13-year-old Agnes is a pupil at Ng'ate Primary School in Thika, Kenya, and receives a daily mug of porridge through one of our Porridge Club schemes. 
    <br> <br>

<em>"On behalf of the pupils of Ng'ate Primary School, I would like to thank you for the porridge feeding programme in our school. Our pupils are healthier than other children in the community. We are learning more quickly because we are not hungry and hardly ever have a day off school anymore. The porridge gives us the energy to run and learn. THANK YOU!"</em></p>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<h2>MAKE A DONATION</h2>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>By supporting our work, a little really can go a long way. A $9 donation, will provide 100 children with a porridge meal that means they go to school rather than having to work, scavenge or beg on the streets.</p>
