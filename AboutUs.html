<h1>About Us</h1>
<br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>Save in Humanity was founded in 2006 by Peter Tyler and Angeles Merlin to support local initiatives to benefit under-served children. The projects we support are run by local staff who are committed to - and know the needs of - their own communities. <br> <br>

Africa's children need an education if Africa is to prosper. That is why we focus on giving children what they need to get that education which in turn gives them hope for a bright future.</p>

<br> <br>
<p> <em>It was the Head Teacher at a school in Kenya who told us what stops children attending his school: the first is a lack of food in the family, meaning children have to work, scavenge or beg on the streets during the day, or be hungry at school. The second is the un-affordability of sanitary protection for girls, forcing them to miss a week of school each month. </em>
     <br>
<br>
Once these causes were identified, the solutions were not difficult – providing school meals and sanitary towels have proved highly effective in ensuring poor children have the chance of a full-time education and the skills to build a better life for themselves.
<br>

Other local initiatives we support include a nursery school and sanitary towels programme for teenage girls in Tanzania; legal aid for children and families in Kenya and Tanzania; the provision of educational resources and counselling for children infected or affected by HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe; and slum dweller education forums in Uganda to promote children’s rights.
